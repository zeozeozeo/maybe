# Making levels

Levels are simply just images which are embedded into the executable with [cmrc](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/cmrc). 1 pixel = 1 tile. You can use any image editor to create them.

|    Color    |      Tile      |
| :---------: | :------------: |
| 255,255,255 |      Air       |
|    0,0,0    |     Solid      |
|   0,255,0   | Start position |
